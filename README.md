## Rules of the Game
### Set up:
A deck of cards is split evenly between 2 players. So each player has 26 cards

### Playing the Game:
The players cards are compared to each other and whoever has the highest card value wins the round and adds both cards to their deck. If the cards are equal in value, WAR IS DECLARED!

### WAR TIME:
When war is declared, each player throws down 3 cards face down and a 4th card to compare. Whoever gets the highest scoring card collects all of the cards that were thrown down from each player.

### How the Winner is determined:
The winner of the game is the person who has collected all the cards!

## Highest Scoring Card
I've formated my game so that the **Ace** is the highest scoring card

## How to Play:
<!-- OL -->

1. Fork and clone this repository
1. Open the script.js file in the code editor of your choice (I use VS Code)
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. The game happens entirely in the console so you have to be able to read it!
1. Open the Terminal and write **node script.js** to read how the game played itself out!
